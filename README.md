## Prerequisites
- AWS CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
- Permissions in AWS to create resources and configured: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html

## Basic Website (static)
The website is generated by running the script: `cloudformation.sh` which deploys a CloudFormation stack using `cloudformation.json` as a template.
It takes `BucketName` as a parameter, which must be globally unique.

### S3 Hosted
By default, this cloudformation stack creates a S3 hosted site. This offers a http endpoint where basic site logic is available.
This endpoint is given as `S3WebsiteURL` in the Cloudformation Outputs, and is of the format: `http://<BucketName>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com`

The index page of the website can be directly access via a https endpoint.
This endpoint is given as `S3BucketSecureURL` in the Cloudformation Outputs, and is of the format: `https://<BucketName>.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html`

#### S3 Public Access
If you block all public access at the account level, Amazon S3 will continue to block public access to the bucket.
In this scenario, you would have to edit your account-level Block Public Access settings.
